# This is the second version of my A/V Schedule App.

What's different?
- One thing, really: The first version was my first app. I hadn't learned testing yet; I just wanted to make an app.
- So I'll design this version with TDD in mind.

Where's the first version? [A/V Schedule v1 is here on Github](https://github.com/douglasmanzelmann/avschedule).
